# amokmadskillz Personal website

This is my personal website built using ReactJS and Bulma as the CSS framework. [Live here](https://menoudeh90.netlify.com)

The personal information on the website is populated from a json file that follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) open source standard.


## Build

1. Clone the repo:
```console
> git clone 
```

2. Update the *resume.json* with your personal information (check [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/))

3. Install dependencies and run build command:
```console
> npm install
> npm run build
```

You can also test the app with a development server, just run:

```console
> npm start
```
